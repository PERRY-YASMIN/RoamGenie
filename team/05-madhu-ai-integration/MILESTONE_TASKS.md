# Milestone Tasks

M1 use cases/schemas; M2 mock; M3 structured recommendation context; M4 real adapter/fallback; M5 failure tests; M6 AI explanation.

At each milestone: pull `develop` → complete issue → run owned tests → test the integration boundary → attach evidence → PR to `develop` → resolve review → update progress log. Do not begin work that relies on an unfrozen contract.

## Supabase milestones

M0: create Supabase project, safe access, environment/connection choice and empty-database health check. M1: approve Supabase-compatible ERD, SQLAlchemy model plan, Alembic/SQL ownership and API fields. M2: run initial migration/seeds, verify Table Editor and complete React auth → FastAPI → Supabase. M3: seed/query/index catalogues and complete one DB→API→React module. M4: transactionally store trip/AI-validated itinerary/expenses, verify Dashboard and reopen in React. M5: test invalid URL/password/host, timeout/outage/recovery, migrations/missing table/constraints, cross-user authorization, public exposure, secret scan, backup/restore and fresh recreation. M6: export backup and demonstrate tables, JOIN, aggregate, view, routine, trigger, transactions/indexes and complete React flow with offline evidence.

Role focus: AI calls backend services and receives validated structured records. It never receives Supabase credentials, executes arbitrary SQL, changes tables or invents trusted IDs. FastAPI validates referenced IDs and persists accepted output. Preserve mock mode.
