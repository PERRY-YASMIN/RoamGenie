# Integration Guide

1. Confirm request fields, response fields, types, optionality, errors, and tables.
2. Pull `develop` and run baseline tests.
3. Integrate only the smallest owned vertical slice.
4. Check valid, invalid, unauthorized, empty, and dependency-failure cases.
5. Notify upstream/downstream owners of contract changes; do not silently rename fields.
6. Attach sample request/response, mock output, fallback test, validation failure, sanitized logs.
7. Merge only after tests and relevant review pass.

## Supabase integration

AI calls backend services and receives validated structured records. It never receives Supabase credentials, executes arbitrary SQL, changes tables or invents trusted IDs. FastAPI validates referenced IDs and persists accepted output. Preserve mock mode.

Verify the owned feature through Supabase object → SQLAlchemy/repository → service → FastAPI → React and attach migration/seed/test plus Dashboard evidence. Do not accept manual Dashboard state as integration.
