# Integration Guide

1. Confirm request fields, response fields, types, optionality, errors, and tables.
2. Pull `develop` and run baseline tests.
3. Integrate only the smallest owned vertical slice.
4. Check valid, invalid, unauthorized, empty, and dependency-failure cases.
5. Notify upstream/downstream owners of contract changes; do not silently rename fields.
6. Attach landing, login errors, trip validation, loading/empty/error states, itinerary, budget warning, saved trip, assistant, mobile menu.
7. Merge only after tests and relevant review pass.

## Supabase integration

React calls FastAPI only. Do not add the Supabase JavaScript client or any database/service-role credential. Use contract-matched mock API data while endpoints are pending. Dashboard is not the app UI; its screenshots are presentation evidence only.

Verify the owned feature through Supabase object → SQLAlchemy/repository → service → FastAPI → React and attach migration/seed/test plus Dashboard evidence. Do not accept manual Dashboard state as integration.
